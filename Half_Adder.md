#  Half Adder 
A Half Adder is a combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary inputs. It produces a Sum and a Carry output without considering any carry-in.

##  Truth Table
| Input A | Input B | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
|   0     |    0    |     0    |     0      |
|   0     |    1    |     1    |     0      |
|   1     |    0    |     1    |     0      |
|   1     |    1    |     0    |     1      |

##  Boolean Equations
- **Sum (S)** = A ⊕ B  
- **Carry (C)** = A ⋅ B
Where:  
- `⊕` is the XOR operation  
- `⋅` is the AND operation
